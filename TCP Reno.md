- Slow start
    - Increase window size till timeout
        - Get slowstart threshold, which is half of timeout window
        - Slowstart to the threshold
- Perform additive increase
    - Till [[Triple duplicate acknowledgement]]
    - Then multiplicative decrease by half
    - Protocol also known as [[AIMD]]

The whole protocol gives a Saw Tooth graph shape.
