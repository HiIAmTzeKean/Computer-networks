# Wireless

## Regulation
- Limit on transmission power
- Spectrum spread
    - Spread signal over wide frequency to reduce interference
    - [[Frequency hopping]]
        - Transmitting over random frequencies
    - [[Direct sequence technique]]
- Mobility
    - Initial version of WiMAX did not allow movement
    - Bluetooth allows movement within range of base
    - 4G allows mobility between bases
## IEEE 802.11
Wi-Fi standard
- Challenge is mediate multiple access in shared space
- Evolution of 802.11
    - Initially used [[Frequency hopping]] and [[Direct sequence technique]]
    - Physical layer standard later added and uses licence exempt 2.4GHz band
    - Later added 5GHz
    - Other protocols like OFDM and MIMO subsequently added to increase [[Bandwidth]]
- [[CSMA_CA]]
