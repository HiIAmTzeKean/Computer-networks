# Direct sequence technique

- Each bit in frame represented by multiple bits
- A random sequence is made known to sender and receiver
    - Random sequence of n bits typically higher bit rate than actual data rate
    - The output of XOR will be of a higher bit rate
- Sender XOR message with random sequence and sends the output
- The normal data stream will be spread across a wider frequency
- The transmitted value is known as n-bit chipping code
