# CSMA_CD

Carrier sense multiple access - collision detection.
- Host senses link if it is idle before transmission
- Host listens to what it transmit and if there is a collision with other frames

## Types of CSMA
- p-persistent CSMA
    - If host is ready, it continuously senses link and transmit with probability of p if link idle
- 1-persistent CSMA
    - If host is ready, it continuously senses link and transmit with probability of 1
    - Greedy approach
