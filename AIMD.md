# AIMD

Additive increase Multiplicative Decrease.

## Why is this optimal
- Additive increase
    - Brings the point of the graph 45degrees to the left
- Multiplicative decrease
    - Brings the point towards the origin
    - Note that this may not be 45 degrees, it is with respect to the point to the origin

If additive decrease was used instead, the decrease would be in the 45degrees direction. There is no way to guarantee the convergence to optimal.
